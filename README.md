# Detour

A toy proof-checker for a mix of first-order predicate and second-order propositional logic natural deduction proofs in a Fitch-style notation.

## TODO:
- [x] remove the substitution `Const2Term`
- [ ] maybe have a special kind of term like `Rigid` variable? I don't remember for what, though.


## TODO:
- [x] a switch `--lem=true/false` that disallows (or allows) the *proof by contradiction* rule
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [x] the Data Type Representation
- [x] named axioms in the global scope
- [ ] ~~named sub-proofs in the global scope~~

- [ ] Proof-checking
  - [x] Unification
  - [x] `check'rule`

- [ ] Custom syntax
  - [x] parsing syntax definitions

- [ ] Custom Rules
  - [x] parsing judgment definitions
  - [x] user-defined judgments
    - [x] rules
    - [ ] type-check the rule definitions (formulae in the premises and the result parts are well-formed)
    - [x] implement `check-rule` for custom rules
      - [x] the âˆ€-elim part
      - [x] the ==>-elim part

-- TODO:  This file implements checking for one theorem.

-- TODO:  This function goes one derivation at a time and checks them using unification and such.
--        I can use local to record the current theorem I am checking so that if it fails
--        I have the information in the environment and can report it in the Error.
--        Or, I could just track the location of the error and report just that.
--        This would be the first time I would do that Â·_.
